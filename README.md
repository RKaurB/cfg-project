# CFG Recipe Search Project

A recipe search program that uses Python to find recipes according to the user's chosen ingredient(s) and other search criteria, including preferred cuisine type (e.g. British, Italian, Indian), dietary requirements (e.g. vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free), diet regime (e.g. low-fat, low-carb), and maximum calories.
