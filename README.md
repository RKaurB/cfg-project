# CFG Recipe Search Project

A recipe search program that uses Python and the Edamam API to find and print recipes according to the user's chosen ingredient(s) and other search criteria, including preferred cuisine type (e.g. British, Italian, Indian), dietary requirements (e.g. vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free), diet regime (e.g. low-fat, low-carb), and maximum calories. 

This project was presented alongside [ioanatovirnac](https://github.com/ioanatovirnac) and [CamilleBarbit](https://github.com/camillebarbit) as part of our final group project for the [Code First Girls](https://codefirstgirls.org.uk/) 8-week Introduction to Python Programming course.
